.. _Requirements-label:

Requirements to establish Software Attestation
----------------------------------------------

Software Attestation is dependent upon the Octeon Trusted-Mode Boot feature.

Additionally, the following components must be procured:

   - private signing key (in DER format)
   - signing certificate (in DER format)
   - secret passphrase

The signing certificate and private key are standard components of Public
Key Cryptography.  These should be generated in a manner consistent with the
organization's Information Technology practices.

The secret passphrase can be any ASCII text.

These items are used to generate the <attestation_signing_file>, which is
used as part of the Trusted-Mode Boot build.

Details of how to generate a unique <attestation_signing_file> are described in
the section :ref:`Generating Software Attestation Signing File <Generating-Signing-label>`, below.

A default <attestation_signing_file> exists in the Trusted-Mode Boot build,
for demonstration purposes only.

This default data should be used to verify the Trusted-Mode Boot configuration
prior to generating a unique <attestation_signing_file>.

.. _Creating-Trusted-label:

Creating the Trusted-Mode Boot image
------------------------------------

A Trusted-Mode Boot image can be created using the following steps::

  $ cd <install_dir>/sdk-base
  $ script -c "./scripts/ci/compile.sh --bsne cn96xx -r <release-id>" make.log

Afterward, certain information (i.e. <fuse_data>) must be extracted from the
build procedure in order to use the Trusted-Mode Boot image.  This information
will be used in the subsequent step :ref:`Booting the Trusted-Mode Boot image <Booting-Trusted-label>`.
To obtain this information, use the following::

  $ grep FUSF_ROTPK <install_dir>/sdk-base/make.log

    NOTE: this will display information as follows:

    FUSF_ROTPK[0]: <hex_value>
    FUSF_ROTPK[1]: <hex_value>
    FUSF_ROTPK[2]: <hex_value>
    FUSF_ROTPK[3]: <hex_value>

  $ grep FUSF_SW <attestation_signing_file>

    NOTE: this will display information as follows:

    * FUSF_SW2: <hex_value>
    * FUSF_SW3: <hex_value>
    * FUSF_SW4: <hex_value>
    * FUSF_SW5: <hex_value>


The default (sample) <attestation_signing_file> is located at::

    <install_dir>/cn96xx-release-output/build/arm-trusted-firmware-custom/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx2/t96/include/attestation_signing_key.h

However, if a unique <attestation_signing_file> was used in the build,
specify its location instead.

The Trusted-Mode Boot image can be found at the following location::

  <install_dir>/cn96xx-release-output/images/octeontx-bootfs-uboot.img

This image can be installed using the standard update procedure.

.. _Booting-Trusted-label:

Booting the Trusted-Mode Boot image
-----------------------------------

In order to boot the Trusted-Mode Boot image, the board must first be configured
to do so (see the User's Guide for details).

Next, various fuses in the board must be set (i.e. blown).
The following procudure describes a "soft-blow" technique, which allows the use
of Trusted-Mode Boot for testing purposes, and is NOT suitable to a production
environment (i.e. the fuses will only retain their value until the board is
power-cycled).

Procedure::

   a. Power-cycle the host; perform the remaining steps using the serial console
   b. Select 'B' to display the "Boot Menu"
   c. At the Boot Menu prompt, select 'D' to enter "Diagnostics"
      NOTE: this may result in a restart where the user is again prompted to
            "Press 'B' ... for boot menu" (there will only be a single restart).
            Continue with step 'b' above
   d. Once loaded, the diagnostics will present a "Main Menu";
      select option 17, for "Trusted Boot options", which will display the
      "Trusted Boot Menu".
   e. Select option 7 for "Soft blow SHA256 of the Root-of-Trust Public Key..."
   f. refer to the <fuse_data> information obtained in the step
      'Creating the Trusted-Mode Boot image' and enter the values for each of
      FUSF_ROTPK[n].  After all four (4) values are entered,
      the "Trusted Boot Menu" will again be displayed.
   g. Select option 11, "Soft blow Software Fuses (SW)"
      For the first two options, enter the value '0', as follows:

          (INS)FUSF_SW(0)[31:0] (0 - 4294967295) [0]: 0 <Enter>
          (INS)FUSF_SW(0-1)[Non-secure NV counter] (0 - 96) [0]: 0 <Enter>

      Refer to the <fuse_data> information obtained in the step
      'Creating the Trusted-Mode Boot image' and enter the values for each of
      FUSF_SW2..FUSF_SW5.

      Enter the value '0' when prompted for FUSF_SW(6..7).
      After all values have been entered, the "Trusted Boot Menu" will again
      be displayed.
   h. Select option 14, "Main menu", then select option 18, "Reboot"
   i. After rebooting, select 'B' to display the "Boot Menu".

      NOTE: above the boot menu prompt, the following text should be displayed,
      which will verify that Trusted-Mode Boot has been configured properly.

      "Trust: Enabled, Secure Boot"

   j. Select 'N' to boot normally, which will boot U-Boot as usual.

.. _Testing-label:

Testing Software Attestation
----------------------------

Testing the Software Attestation consists of the following steps:

   - Executing the U-Boot 'attest' command
   - Retrieving the attestation signed image and signature
   - Authenticating the attestation signed image

The 'attest' command must be executed from U-Boot.  For example, at the
U-Boot prompt, issue the following command::

   CN3380_250SV> attest abcd

   NOTE: the 'abcd' is the Nonce value
   (refer to Octeon TX2 Software Attestation specification)

The signed image, entitled "Attestation [signed] Image", will be output on
the console, followed by the signature, entitled "Authentication signature".
These items will be output as hexadecimal dumps and must be saved to separate
text files (i.e. image.txt and image.sig.txt).

To authenticate the attestation signed image, convert the saved text files
(i.e. image.txt and image.sig.txt) into binary files.  For example::

   $ xxd -r image.txt > image.bin
   $ xxd -r image.sig.txt > image.bin.sig

Then, obtain the public key for the private signing key.

NOTE: If the default <attestation_signing_file> was used, the private
signing key exists as::

    <install_dir>/cn96xx-release-output/build/arm-trusted-firmware-custom/tools/attestation_signing/example-attestation-signing-key.der

To obtain the public key from the private key, use the following command::

   $ openssl pkey -in <signing_key> -inform DER -pubout -out key.pub

The public key will exist in 'key.pub'.

Finally, use OpenSSL to perform the authentication using the following command::

   $ openssl dgst -sha256 -verify key.pub -signature image.bin.sig image.bin

The authentication status will be displayed as one of the following::

   "Verified OK":          success
   "Verification Failure": failure

Similarly, the x509 certificate included in the attestation information can
be verified.  This will have been output on the console as a hexadecimal dump
entitled "Certificate".  Save this data as a text file (cert.txt) then
validate it using the following::

   $ xxd -r cert.txt > cert.bin
   $ openssl x509 -in cert.bin -inform DER -noout -text

.. _Generating-Signing-label:

Generating Software Attestation Signing File
--------------------------------------------

As previously mentioned, the <attestation_signing_file> contains signing data
for the Software Attestation feature.

This section describes how to generate and use this file.

The script to create the <attestation_signing_file> can be found in the build
directory, after having created a Trusted-Mode Boot image.  The script is
located at::

   <install_dir>/cn96xx-release-output/build/arm-trusted-firmware-custom/tools/attest_signing/encrypt_signing_key.sh

Assemble all the required signing components and the aforementioned script into
a work directory (i.e. <work_dir>).
For requirements, see section :ref:`Requirements to establish Software Attestation <Requirements-label>`.

Change to the <work_dir> directory and execute the following command::

   $ sh encrypt_signing_key.sh <signing_key> <cert_file> [passphrase]

     where:
       <signing_key>: the private key used to sign the attestation information
       <cert_file>:   the certificate included in the attestation information
       [passphrase]:  arbitrary ASCII text used as input to the pseudo-random-
                      key-generator (PRKG)

   NOTE: execute the script without arguments for a description of usage.

Upon completion, the script will have generated 'attestation_signing_key.h'.
This is the <attestation_signing_file> which must be used in the
Trusted-Mode Boot build procedure.

To use the newly created <attestation_signing_file>, export its location via::

   $ export ATTESTATION_SIGNING_KEY_FILE="<path_to_attestation_signing_file>"

   NOTE: use quotations and specify the complete file path.

Finally, [re]build the Trusted-Mode Boot image as per the section entitled
:ref:`Creating the Trusted-Mode Boot image <Creating-Trusted-label>`, making sure to do so from an
environment that includes the exported 'ATTESTATION_SIGNING_KEY_FILE' variable.
After installing the new Trusted-Mode Boot image, proceed with the section
entitled :ref:`Booting the Trusted-Mode Boot image <Booting-Trusted-label>`.
